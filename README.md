# Electron_Microscopy-Data_Engineering
This repository documents a series of data engineering tasks focused on several large-scale 3D Electron Microscopy (EM) datasets from different sources.

## Summary

 The main objectives were:

- **Automated Data Downloading:**  Developed code and workflows to efficiently download large volumetric datasets from public repositories.
- **Metadata Extraction:** Extracted and consolidated relevant metadata from each dataset into a Markdown/CSV file
- **Dataset Organization:** Structured the repo in such a way that each dataset has a dedicated folder, with methods and detailed notes for data access and metadata extraction described in the respective folders.
